Building libCZI                 {#buildinglibCZI}
===============

libCZI aims to be portable and should build readily using any decent C++ compiler. This repository is leveraging the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) system for building.

Here are some instructions for building on Windows and on Linux.



Building on Windows with Visual Studio
--------------------------------------

Visual Studio has [built-in support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-160) for CMake projects. Executing File->Open Folder... and pointing to the folder where the libCZI-repo is located should give something like this:
![libCZI solution](Images/VisualStudio_cmake1.png "libCZI solution")
@image latex VisualStudio_cmake1.png "libCZI solution"
The project should compile and build without further ado.

For building on the command-line, it is recommended to do an out-of-source build. Executing those commands will execute all steps - go to the folder where the libCZI-repo is located:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

Building on Linux
-----------------

The same steps as above will build the code - go into the folder where the libCZI-repo is located, and run

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .


Configurations
--------------

The CMake-file defines the following options for customizing the build:

option                                     | description
-------------------------------------------|------------
LIBCZI_BUILD_UNITTESTS                     | Whether to build the unit-tests for libCZI. Default is **ON**.
LIBCZI_BUILD_CZICMD                        | Whether to build the test- and sample-application CZICmd. Default is **OFF**.
LIBCZI_BUILD_DYNLIB                        | Whether to build the dynamic link libaray for libczi. Default is **ON**.
LIBCZI_BUILD_PREFER_EXTERNALPACKAGE_EIGEN3 | Whether to use an existing Eigen3-library on the system (included via find_package). If this is OFF, then a copy of Eigen3 is downloaded as part of the build. Default is **OFF**.
LIBCZI_BUILD_PREFER_EXTERNALPACKAGE_ZSTD   | Whether to use an existing zstd-library on the system (included via find_package). If this is OFF, then a copy of zstd is downloaded as part of the build. Default is **OFF**.

If building CZICmd is desired, then running CMake with this command line will enable building CZICmd:
    
    cmake .. -DLIBCZI_BUILD_CZICMD=ON

Building CZICmd requires the external package RapidJSON to be available. In addition, on Linux the packages ZLIB, PNG and (optionally) Freetype are needed.

If necessary, they can be installed like this (assuming a Debian based distro):

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
    sudo apt-get install rapidjson-dev


Building the documentation
--------------------------

Executing <tt>doxygen</tt> will produce the HTML documentation in the folder ../Src/Build folder.
