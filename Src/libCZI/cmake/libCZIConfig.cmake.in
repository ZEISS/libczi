# This module is automatically installed by CMake and vcpkg when the libCZI package is installed.
# It is included via `find_package(libCZI CONFIG REQUIRED)` in downstream projects.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Provide a consistent and user-friendly interface to downstream users
#   - Ensure dependencies are found
#   - Map internal target names (e.g., libCZIStatic or libCZIShared) to a canonical alias: libczi::libCZI

include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)

# Find all required dependencies that libCZI expects clients to link against.
# These must also be declared in vcpkg.json dependencies to work properly across all platforms.
find_dependency(zstd CONFIG REQUIRED)
find_dependency(Eigen3 CONFIG REQUIRED)

# Import the actual targets provided by the build (static or shared)
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/libCZITargets.cmake")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Canonical ALIAS: libczi::libCZI
#
# This alias ensures downstream code can always use `libczi::libCZI`,
# regardless of whether a static or shared version was built.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Map the actual built target to the canonical alias libczi::libCZI
