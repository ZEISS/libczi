## What
libCZI is an Open Source Cross-Platform C++ library to read and write [CZI](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen/czi-image-file-format.html).

## Why
libCZI is a library intended for providing read and write access to [CZI](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen/czi-image-file-format.html) featuring:

* reading subblocks and get the content as a bitmap
* reading subblocks which are compressed with JPEG-XR
* works with tiled images and pyramid images
* composing multi-channel images with tinting and applying a gradation curve
* access metadata
* writing subblocks and metadata

In a nutshell, it offers (almost...) the same functionality as the 2D-Viewer in [ZEN](https://www.zeiss.com/microscopy/en/products/software/zeiss-zen.html) - in terms of composing the image (including display-settings) and managing the data found in a CZI-file.
