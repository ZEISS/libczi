Multi-channel-composition
=========================

Multi-channel-composition is the operation of combining a set of channels (usually grayscale images) into a one colored image.  

The operation (as implemented by the function Compositors::ComposeMultiChannel) is controlled by the following options:

* tinting by a color
* definition of a black- and white-point
* a gradiation curve
  
The steps in the operation are:

::

  Let result R-G-B pixel value = 0,0,0
  For each channel
      If tinting is enabled for this channel:
          * get normalized pixel value
          * apply gradation
          * multiply with R-G-B tinting color
          * add R-G-B value to result pixel 
      If tinting is disabled for this channel:
          * get normalized R-G-B value
          * apply gradation to R, G and B
          * add R-G-B value to result pixel 


The operation "Apply gradiation" works in the following way: the normalized pixel value is mapped to an integer (in the range 0..255) by looking
up a value:

Above a linear gradation curve is shown. There are three ways commonly used to define the gradation curve:
* linear (a straight line from the point [black point,0] to [white point,255] - as shown above)
* gamma (instead of a straight line we use an exponential with the exponent gamma as a parameter)
* defined by a spline

In the function Compositors::ComposeMultiChannel the gradation curve is given as an array of bytes. Those bytes give the RGB-value at 
uniformly distributed points between black point and white point. Values between those points are interpolated linearly.

For example, the parameters white_point=0.2, black_point=1.0 and lookupTable={0, 66, 100, 166, 255} will result in this gradation curve:

For generating a look-up-table (which then can be used for Compositors::ComposeMultiChannel) two utility functions are provided:
Utils::Create8BitLookUpTableFromSplines and Utils::Create8BitLookUpTableFromGamma.
